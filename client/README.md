### Notes

- Vue3, Vue cli 4

- Utilizing Semantic HTML5 to increase SEO readability

- Grid

- Flexbox

- assets used by iframe are sourced from public path instead of src

- assets used by img are sourced from relative src path

### TO-DO

add a mark on the calendar for selected/view date vs current Date
add arrows around date to allow easier movement from one day to another

search functionality

display multiple events over lapping on the same time slots - ideas: cards/ google calendar/ ect
decide on how to display multiple to-do items

custom text input for duration timer: only num validation

enable editting of to-do list items: allow a user to go back and reselect start time or end time

add in recipe page - enable association of recipe with to-do item - create baking timelines

create different views - weekly & monthly

add in calendar interactions ie: if there is an event on said day

fix add event styling/ create labels for event target date and event target time

fix search spacing while add event is open

fix design spacing

refactor css (set a standard for rem units)

make responsive- add media queries/ breakpoints

change from 15 min intervals to hours and convert grid to 24 hours with 60 rows per hour

move sign-in/ sign-out to a more obvious place

~~current time ticker- don't remember what this is~~

~~fix displaying of to list items that exceed 24 hours~~

---

### BUG

~~fix duration display: days/hrs/mins vs day/hr/min~~

~~when opening calendar, resets date~~
